# PhidgetsSpatialPrecision333AccelGyroCompass
Wrapper (including ability to hook to Tkinter GUI) to read spatial data from 3-axis accelerometer, 3-axis gyro, and 3-axis magnetometer. Outputs the sensor's orientation (calculated via IMU or AHRS algorithm) in quaternions and Euler angles, as well as the raw sensor data.
